# Animation in TApp

While VueJS provides basic animation primitives and CSS keeps on increasing its reach, a native app has more expectations on it for professional animation. For that reason, and just cuz we like bouncing balls and things, we have added the [Motion One]() library.

## Motion One

[Motion One](https://motion.dev/docs) is an animation library that provides professional level features but at a very small JS payload. It also takes advantage of the <pop text="Web Animations API (WAAPI)">WAAPI</pop> where possible and when doing so gets direct access to the device's GPUs leading to some impressive performance metrics.

Not only is it _good_ but it's also relatively easy. At least as far as these things go.
